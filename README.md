# Unit 1: Objects

*Standard 2 - Understand and construct simple computer programs*

Practice programming activities, summative lab, and documentation for Unit 1 (Chapters 1-2).


# Turtle Lab

# Purpose

The goal of this lab for you to experience what your first assignment as a software developer at a software company may be like. You will be working with a large body of code (Turtle and TurtleWorld) with which you are unfamiliar. You don't understand all of the intricacies of the existing code base and you aren't yet familiar with many of the Java language features that you will use. However, through experimentation and browsing the documentation, you will be able to complete this assignment and most likely go beyond the requirements!

# Requirements

* Open the Unit 1 GitHub assignment which will create your repository for this unit (You already did this.)

* Commit to GitHub, at least daily, with a meaningful commit message describing what you accomplished and what needs to be done next.

* Create your class in the TurtleLab project in your objects folder

* Draw a pattern using at least two Turtle objects.

* Invoke multiple methods on the turtle objects to change their attributes.

* Follow our[ Java style guidelines](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5RGLWvvovYUc09POEhNaXQ3ODg&authuser=0).

* Read the documentation in doc/SimpleTurtle.html.

* Demonstrate your program to your instructor and receive feedback before submitting.

# Extensions

* Make the world larger so that I can print your pattern and maintain reasonable resolution

    * World myWorld = new World( width, height );

* Make a more sophisticated pattern.

* Make a pattern that involves multiple colors.

* Change the picture for the turtle to something else.

* Something else? Be creative and share!

* Add More Awesome.

# Submission

* Submit a link to your GitHub repository with this assignment.

    * Copy the URL to GitHub.com and paste into the Canvas assignment and submit

* If you would like your Turtle Lab featured on the school TVs, take a screenshot of your image and add it to the [shared Google slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qgY3QCRyaDp1gSLUltV9g_Uj3aU4cnNf987gRM_bgjw/edit?usp=sharing) based on the provided template slide.
